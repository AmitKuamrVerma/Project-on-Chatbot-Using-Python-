##  AI Chatbot in Python

This is a mini project developed as part of my academic journey at Invertis University. It showcases a simple AI chatbot built using Python, designed to simulate human-like conversations using basic NLP techniques.

###  Features

- Text-based chatbot interface  
- Rule-based responses using Python logic  
- Simple and intuitive user interaction  
- Modular code structure for easy understanding

###  Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Tkinter (for GUI)  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- Basic file handling and string operations

###  Project Structure

```
AI-Chatbot/
â”œâ”€â”€ chatbot.py           # Main Python script
â”œâ”€â”€ responses.txt        # Predefined responses
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ assets/              # Any images or icons used
```

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Chatbot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Chatbot
   ```
3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
